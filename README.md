# CP-Badges

What if there are badges on Github profile that show our Codeforces ratings with the rating colour as well?

`So I decided to make my own!`

This repo helps you to create your custom profile badges with Max rating in Codechef, Codeforces and many more.

`Maybe you can flaunt more with your coding badges now.`
