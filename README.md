# CP-Badges

What if there are badges on Github profile that show our Codeforces ratings with the rating colour as well? 

So I decided to make my own!

This repo helps you to create your custom profile badges with max rating in Codechef, Codeforces and Atcoder.

Maybe you can flaunt more with your coding badges now.

This will add a link to the badge

[![Badge](https://cp-logo.vercel.app/codechef/gennady.korotkevich)](https://www.codechef.com/users/gennady.korotkevich)

## Fun Fact
